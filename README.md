# Sentiment-Analysis-Logistic-Regression-Deployment
This project demonstrates the complete development lifecycle of a Machine Learning model for sentiment analysis. Using the IMDb dataset (50,000 reviews), we trained a classifier capable of distinguishing between positive and negative reviews, then optimized it for deployment on an Arduino microcontroller.
